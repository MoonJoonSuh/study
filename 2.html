    On behalf of the United States of America, I deeply regret that Korean civilians lost their lives at No Gun Ri in late July, 1950. 
    The intensive, yearlong investigation into this incident has served 
    as a painful reminder of the tragedies of war and the scars they leave behind on people and on nations.

    Although we have been unable to determine precisely the events that occurred at No Gun Ri, 
    the U.S. and South Korean governments have concluded in the Statement of Mutual Understanding that an unconfirmed number of innocent 
    Korean refugees were killed or injured there.
